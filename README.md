## About Blood Lines

#### Data Parsing
Blood Lines uses [GEDCOM-d3](https://github.com/mister-blanket/gedcom-d3), a custom GEDCOM parser designed for this project. It is based off of the [tmcw/parse-gedcom](https://github.com/tmcw/parse-gedcom) project.

#### Visualization
Blood Lines uses [3D Force-Directed Graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph) for visualization.

## About GEDCOM
[GEDCOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEDCOM) is an open standard for exchanging genealogical data between different genealogy software. If you have created a family tree using a computer program or website, chances are you can export your data as a GEDCOM file.

If you haven't created a family tree, but are interested, there are many websites and applications available to help you do so. I recommend [GRAMPS](https://gramps-project.org/introduction-WP/), which is free and open-source genealogy software.
